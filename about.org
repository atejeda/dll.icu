#+TITLE: About this website
#+DESCRIPTION: About this website

Meant to be used as a second brain and as a reference for things I'm interested
in, including but not limited to technical topics related to computer science.

This site is powered by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]] in a static site generator fashion,
each page provides a link in the footer in which one can download the source
org file.

DNS configuration is managed through [[https://www.cloudflare.com]],
served by [[https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/][DigitalOcean App Platform]] and deployed by using [[https://github.com/features/actions][Github Actions]],
nothing too fancy, keep it simple.

The look and feel is intended to have a minimal memory footprint, hence the
simplicity of using a set of minimal HTML resources like javascript scripts and
css styling, providing a less cluttered content - easy to read.

I'm reachable on twitter as [[https://twitter.com/alexmeistercl][@alexmeistercl]].
